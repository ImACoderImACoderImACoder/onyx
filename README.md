# Getting Started with Project Onyx

## What is Project Onyx?

Project Oynx is a single page web application that interfaces with the Volcano Hybrid. The way the official web application works was not working for me so I made my own. After an initial POC I was enjoying the project and wanted to code something I'd be proud of :D

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Icons from font-awesome free edition. [License Link](https://fontawesome.com/license).

## Developer Documentation

To learn more about the inner workings of the volcano or project onyx read the [developer documentation.](./Documentation/TableOfContents/Developer%20Documentation.pdf) Pdf links don't work inside of github's pdf viewer, for the best experience view the docs outside of github.
